I was a Ph.D student in [State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System](http://robot.hit.edu.cn){:target="_blank"} , [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn){:target="_blank"} (HIT), advised by [Prof. Yili Fu](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/fuyili){:target="_blank"} . and then I served as a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in the MAE department at CUHK for half a year.

I received M.S. degree at [Center for Precision Engineering](http://cpe.hit.edu.cn){:target="_blank"} , [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn){:target="_blank"} (HIT), advised by [Prof. Yongda Yan](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/yanyongda){:target="_blank"} .

I received B.E. degree at [School of Mechatronics Engineering](http://sme.hit.edu.cn){:target="_blank"} , [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn){:target="_blank"} (HIT), advised by [Prof. Nianli Lu](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/lunianli){:target="_blank"} .

My research interests are vision-based soft object manipulation, vision-based surgical tool tracking and control, and developments of surgical robot systems, with emphasis on both scientific and engineering aspects.
